# Day-Scheduler-App
 This application will allow a user to view an 8 hour time-block, add and save events, and view color coded blocks according to the current time. This application utilized Moment.js, a third party api that allows for the time to be updated and used for else if statements.


# Usage
The app will open and you will see gray for blocks that are earlier than the current time, and green blocks are all available time slots!
